# CMSC-389E-Circuitry

This is the source code for the CMSC 389E Circuitry mod, created for UMD class CMSC 389E. Every class is available to view, entirely unobfuscated. For the time being, it will be kept up-to-date with current commits.

However, having this code available is not to be used to cheat or take advantage of. It is only here for academic purposes, debugging, and a means to effectively collaborate on this project.

More information on the class and what you are expected to do can be found [here](https://cs.umd.edu/class/fall2020/cmsc389E).
